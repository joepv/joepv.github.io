To make sure you don't have to use your smartphone before going to bed Iâ€™ll show you how to use the power of your Home Center 3 and Sonos system to start playing music and automatically set a sleep timer by pressing a button on a wall switch.

Listening to music before bed can help you relax. But you donâ€™t want to wake up in the middle of the night with your favorite bedtime music still playing. To select your favorite artist and configure a sleep timer on the Sonos App you have to use your smartphone. We all know that the blue light emitted by your smartphone screen can disturb your sleep.

> Did you know that if you play songs with 60 to 80 beats per minute they match your resting heart rate and therefore is soothing on a biological level?

I'll show you everything what you need to configure to stop having to use your phone to set a sleep timer on your bedroom Sonos player.

## Prerequisites

- A Sonos player in your bedroom;
- A FIBARO Home Center 3;
- A Z-Wave controller wall switch or module;
- My [Sonos Group Controller Quick App](https://marketplace.fibaro.com/items/sonos-group-controller).

## Goals

- Select some relaxing music to fall asleep;
- Configure your HC3 to run a scene when a button is pressed;
- Control a Sonos speaker from your Home Center 3;
- Sleep well.

## Which integration do you need to control Sonos with your HC3?

The Home Center 3 has native Sonos integration, but the functionally is very limited. There are a lot of Sonos Quick Apps on the [FIBARO Marketplace](https://marketplace.fibaro.com/items?q=sonos), but past year [I decided to write my own QA](https://docs.joepverhaeg.nl/sonos-group-controller/) because I wanted a very lightweight integration and I wanted functionality that didnâ€™t exist; controlling groups. Now, a year later, I updated my Sonos QA with sleep timer functionality.

## Which Z-Wave (wall) controller works best with the HC3?

The FIBARO [Single/Double Switch 2](https://manuals.fibaro.com/switch-2/) or the  [Dimmer 2](https://manuals.fibaro.com/dimmer-2/) can be [configured to run a scene](https://docs.joepverhaeg.nl/hc3-sceneactivation/) when you press momentary switch (multiple times).

For this project I use the [Heatit Z-Push Wall Controller](https://shop.jdkbenelux.com/Heatit-Z-Push-Wall-Controller-White-RAL-9010-Glossy/4512646) to assign a button to control my Sonos system. This is a wireless battery-operated wall switch that can control everything from lights to blinds and more. When you connect this wall controller to the Home Center 3 you can assign a scene to a button and control whatever comes to your imagination.

## How to control Sonos with an HC3 scene?

I assume you have installed my [Sonos Group Controller Quick App](https://marketplace.fibaro.com/items/sonos-group-controller) and configured a Sonos player in your bedroom.

> The sleep timer function also works with speakers in other rooms, you donâ€™t have to go to bed to use this routine. ðŸ˜€

### Before you start

Before you create a new Lua scene you have to pick some nice relaxing music and set it as a favorite in your Sonos App. With the favorite and Sonos player set up in your HC3 get the `id` of the player via **Settings** â†’ **1. Devices,** by searching for your player in the devices list.

### Create the Lua scene

My example code will *pause* the playback on your Sonos *half an hour* after pressing the switch. To calculate the time when your Sonos speaker needs to sleep I use the Lua time function. With this function you have to calculate in seconds. To calculate the future time you have to add *1800 seconds* to the *current* time: `os.date('%H:%M:%S', os.time() + 1800)`. With this in mind you can add a new Lua scene: 

1. Go toÂ **Settings**Â ->Â **11. Scenes**;
2. **Click**Â the blueÂ **Add scene**Â button to add a new scene;
3. Choose the optionÂ **Lua scene**;
4. Give the scene aÂ **name**Â andÂ **click**Â theÂ **Save**Â button;
5. In the **ACTIONS** block of the Lua scene, enter the code:

```lua
-- Sleep after 30 minutes (is 1800 seconds)
local sleepTime = os.date('%H:%M:%S', os.time() + 1800)

hub.call(qaId, "playFavorite", "Relax Radio", "15") -- volume 15%
hub.call(qaId, "configureSleepTimer", sleepTime)
```

Let's say you start this scene at `22:10` then your Sonos speaker will start playing *Relax Radio* at *volume level 15* and go to sleep at `22:40`.

*In this example the variableÂ `qaId`Â is theÂ `id`Â of your Quick App.*

## How to trigger a HC3 scene with the Heatit Z-Push Wall Controller?

Your next step is to start the scene by pressing a button a wall switch. In this example I use the *first button* from the Heatit Z-Push Wall Controller. As I wrote earlier, you can also use other modules that support [scene activation](https://docs.joepverhaeg.nl/hc3-sceneactivation/).

To start the Lua scene with the correct trigger you have to get the `id` from the Heatit Z-Push Wall **Controller** device in the HC3 devices list. This is the device with the black remote icon:

![sonos-inspiration3.png](../assets/images/sonos-inspiration3.png)

Now you have to add the following trigger code to the **Declarations (Conditions/Triggers)** block of the Lua scene you created earlier on:

```lua
{
  conditions = { {
      id = 76,
      isTrigger = true,
      operator = "==",
      property = "centralSceneEvent",
      type = "device",
      value = {
        keyAttribute = "Pressed",
        keyId = 1
      }
    } },
  operator = "all"
}
```

*In this example you have to replace the idÂ `76`Â with theÂ `id`Â of your Heatit Z-Push Wall Controller.*

## The complete Lua scene to control your Sonos speaker with a Heatit Z-Push Wall Controller

If you did all above steps correct you can press the first button on the wall switch and your Sonos speaker will start playing *Relax Radio* at *volume level 15* and go to sleep half an hour later. Youâ€™re complete scene configuration looks like:

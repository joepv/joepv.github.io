While working from home for eight months now I wanted to toggle a light or run a scene from my Windows 10 laptop. After some Googling I didn't find an (free) application so I decided to dust off my some C# knowledge from around 2000 and create a Windows tray application myself.

## Download links for the impatient

* [Version 1.2.0 direct file download](https://github.com/joepv/fibaro-control/releases/download/v1.2.0.0/Fibaro.Control.exe) 
* [Latest release page](https://github.com/joepv/fibaro-control/releases)

## TL;DR

Run a scene or toggle a light on/off from the Windows 10 system tray.

## What my application does

The program loads your configured rooms, devices and scenes from your HC2/HC3/HC3 and puts them in a menu in the system tray. Now you can run a scene or toggle a light switch without reaching for a wall switch or your phone. Neat huh!

## Quick download

You can download the [latest release](https://github.com/joepv/fibaro-control/releases/latest) from the [releases](https://github.com/joepv/fibaro-control/releases) page.

Just select the `Fibaro.Control.exe` file from the assets if you just want to use the program.

## Manual

ðŸ’¡ Note: There is no setup. Just [download](https://github.com/joepv/fibaro-control/releases/latest) and copy the `Fibaro Control.exe` file to `C:\Program Files\`.

Start the `Fibaro Control.exe` program and log in to your Fibaro HC2/HC3:

The login data is automatically encrypted and saved to the Windows registry hive:

```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Joep\FibaroControl
```

## Run a scene

* **Right click** the **HC2/HC3 icon** in the system tray and go to the **scenes** menu.
* **Click** on a scene to **activate** it.

## Toggle a light on/off

* **Right click** the **HC2/HC3 icon** in the system tray and go to the **room** menu where the light is located.
* **Click** on a **light source** to turn it **on** or **off**.

## Changelog

## Future roadmap

The following functions I may add in the future:

* Toggle (Fibaro) Wall Plug that is configured as a switch.
* Add an option to read the Unifi Controller to determine your Windows 10 device location in the office/house and show only the rooms in that location.
